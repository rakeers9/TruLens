    "- **Purpose**: Evaluates response depth based on question complexity\n",
    "- **Method**: Analyzes question type and compares to response length\n",
    "- **Logic**: Complex questions (explain, compare) expect longer responses\n",
    "- **Scoring**: Dynamic based on question indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Response Quality (Custom)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Assesses overall response structure and content quality\n",
    "- **Factors**: Length, sentence structure, content indicators\n",
    "- **Indicators**: Looks for explanatory words (because, therefore, for example)\n",
    "- **Weighted Scoring**: Length (40%) + Structure (30%) + Content (30%)\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the correct output. This type of learning is useful in recommendation systems when there is historical data available with explicit user preferences or ratings. Supervised learning can be used to predict user preferences based on features like user demographics, item attributes, or past interactions. However, it may require a large amount of labeled data for training, which can be challenging to obtain in recommendation systems.\n",

      "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data and aims to find hidden patterns or structures in the input data. In recommendation systems, unsupervised learning can be used for clustering similar users or items based on their characteristics or interactions. It can help in identifying groups of users with similar preferences or items with similar features. However, unsupervised learning may not always provide explicit recommendations based on user preferences, as it focuses more on data patterns and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. In recommendation systems, reinforcement learning can be used to optimize long-term user engagement or satisfaction by recommending items that lead to positive outcomes. It can adapt to changing user preferences over time and explore new recommendations. However, reinforcement learning may require more computational resources and time to train compared to supervised or unsupervised learning methods.\n",
