    "\n",
    "#### **1. Answer Relevance (OpenAI-Powered)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Measures how relevant the answer is to the question\n",
    "- **Method**: Uses OpenAI's `relevance_with_cot_reasons` for sophisticated evaluation\n",
    "- **Input**: Question and answer pair\n",
    "- **Output**: Relevance score (0-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Comprehensiveness (Custom)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Evaluates response depth based on question complexity\n",
    "- **Method**: Analyzes question type and compares to response length\n",
    "- **Logic**: Complex questions (explain, compare) expect longer responses\n",
    "- **Scoring**: Dynamic based on question indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Response Quality (Custom)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Assesses overall response structure and content quality\n",
    "- **Factors**: Length, sentence structure, content indicators\n",
    "- **Indicators**: Looks for explanatory words (because, therefore, for example)\n",
    "- **Weighted Scoring**: Length (40%) + Structure (30%) + Content (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why These Metrics Matter:**\n",
    "These feedback functions provide **quantitative evaluation** of RAG system performance, enabling data-driven improvements and comparisons.\n"

    "3. **Runs Evaluations**: Applies feedback functions to each interaction\n",

      "1. **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset where the input data and the corresponding output are provided. In the case of recommendation systems, this could mean having historical data on user preferences and their ratings for items. The algorithm learns to predict recommendations based on this labeled data. For example, a supervised learning algorithm could predict movie recommendations based on user ratings.\n",

      "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find patterns or relationships in the data without explicit guidance. In the context of recommendation systems, unsupervised learning could be used to cluster users or items based on similarities in their preferences. This clustering could then be used to make recommendations to users with similar preferences.\n",

      "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. In the context of recommendation systems, reinforcement learning could be used to continuously learn and adapt recommendations based on user interactions and feedback. The agent (recommendation system) learns through trial and error, receiving rewards (positive feedback) or penalties (negative feedback) based on the recommendations it provides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each type of learning has its strengths and weaknesses in the context of recommendation systems. Supervised learning is useful when historical data is available, unsupervised learning can help discover hidden patterns in data, and reinforcement learning can adapt recommendations based on real-time feedback.
